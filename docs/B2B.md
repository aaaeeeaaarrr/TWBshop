## B2B Orders Bot — b2b_bot/

Handles wholesale orders from restaurant and bar customers via their own Telegram groups.

### B2B Design Rules
- Group chat = the customer. Anyone in the group can order.
- **Multi-user policy (intentional):** State is keyed by group chat_id, not by individual user_id. Any member of the group can build, edit, confirm, or cancel the group's order. This is by design — B2B customers are businesses where multiple staff may need to interact. Actor (name + user_id) is logged at every confirm/edit/cancel/location-change for audit purposes.
- Re-order same day: bot asks "is this extra?", then re-confirms full merged order.
- Gram-required items: pulls from history first, falls back to standard grams (shown in confirmation).
- Attributes (e.g. sesame type): pulls from history first, falls back to menu standard.
- Delivery/pickup: stored per group. New group asked once on first order.
- 10:10:10pm Phnom Penh (UTC+7 = 15:10 UTC): nightly summary to B2B staff group.
- No AI in Phase 1 — rule-based matching only.

### B2B Build Phases
- [x] Phase 1 — Foundation + full order flow
  - Menu, customers, history resolution (grams, attributes), confirmation gate
  - Delivery/pickup stored per group; Grab Express cost via OSRM ($0.68 base + $0.025/90m)
  - Auto-registration: trusted admin adds bot → location pin prompted → cost calculated
  - Bakery coordinates set (11.5387774, 104.9147998)
  - Free delivery threshold ($10+), delivery fee shown when under
  - 9pm pre-summary (totals only, deleted when full fires), 10:10pm full summary
  - 4:30am + 6:10am dispatch reminders (replied to 10:10pm message); 9am 48h mini-order reminder
  - Payment photos/PDFs: AI classifies → billing or order flow; forwarded to OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID
  - Billing: unpaid balances tracked per customer, marked paid oldest-delivery-date-first
  - Daily 6am payment reminder (yesterday's unpaid) + weekly Monday 6am (accumulated balance)
  - /balance and /summary staff commands
- [x] Phase 2 — Recurring daily/weekly orders
  - DB: b2b_recurring_orders + b2b_recurring_confirmations
  - 7am/1pm/6pm reminders the day before fulfillment
  - [Confirm] / [Skip tomorrow] buttons; auto-skip at 10:10pm if still pending
  - Grace period: no reminder if order created ≤1 day before fulfillment
  - Permanent cancel: status = 'cancelled', record kept, bot never sends again
- [ ] Phase 3 — Claude API for smarter matching and future AI features
