## What This System Does
A Telegram-based bakery operations system that handles:
- Customer orders (received, confirmed, stored)
- Daily production totals sent to the bakery staff group
- Per-customer fulfillment lists (who ordered what, pickup/delivery time)
- Staff workstation and fridge photo submissions
- Stock sheet photo uploads (for later OCR processing)
- Staff communications monitoring (for later AI analysis)

---

## Core Architectural Rules (READ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE)

### 1. AI API Calls Only via shared/ai_client.py
All Claude API calls go through `shared/ai_client.py`. No other module imports the
`anthropic` SDK directly. Natural language order parsing stays rule-based (regex,
difflib) — AI is used only for photo analysis and staff message monitoring.
When ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is empty the system falls back to manual-review mode automatically.

### 2. Always Build the Interface First
For every future AI-powered feature, create the function stub now with a placeholder return before wiring up the API. The stub is the contract — build around it first.

### 3. Confirmation Gate Is Mandatory
The bot must ALWAYS restate an interpreted order and ask for explicit confirmation
before saving anything to the database. No silent acceptance of natural language input.
Example flow:
- Customer types something → bot matches to menu items → bot rephrases clearly →
  customer presses [Confirm] or [Edit] → only then save to database.

### 4. Modular Files — Keep Each File Focused
No giant single files. Small, focused modules so Claude Code can load only what's
relevant in future sessions without hitting context limits.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Telegram:** `python-telegram-bot` library
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean (managed) — `psycopg2`, connection via `DATABASE_URL` in secrets.py
- **Fuzzy Matching:** `difflib` (standard library)
- **Logging:** `RotatingFileHandler` — 5MB cap, 3 backups. Unmatched orders log to `logs/unmatched.log`

## Repo Structure
One repo, one business. Each system gets its own folder. Shared infrastructure lives in `shared/`.

## Build Phases

### Retail Bot — Complete
Phases 1–6 done: foundation, menu + ordering, production summaries, photo flow, stock sheets, Claude API layer (OCR, photo analysis, staff monitoring, fallback mode).

---

## New Machine Setup

Just say: **pull**

Claude Code clones the repo, syncs all secrets and SSH keys, and runs bootstrap automatically.
You will be asked for your GitHub PAT (`repo` scope) once — everything else is handled.

PAT creation: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Secrets live in: `github.com/aaaeeeaaarrr/twbshop-secrets` (private)
Claude Code permissions sync automatically via `.claude/settings.json` in this repo.

---

## Key Decisions (Do Not Revisit Without Good Reason)
- **PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean** — migrated from SQLite. All data lives in the managed DO database. No local .db file.
- **Free-first architecture** — API features are additions, not the foundation.
  The bot must work fully without any API calls before any API calls are added.
- **No silent AI guessing** — every ambiguous input goes to a human confirmation step.
  The confirmation gate is not optional, it is the safety mechanism.
- **Telegram only** — no web dashboard, no separate app. Staff and customers
  already use Telegram. Keep the surface area small.

---

## Current Status
> Update this section at the end of every Claude Code session.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-24
**Phase:** Retail bot complete. B2B bot Phase 1 complete. Infrastructure complete.
**Last completed:** B2B improvements — 10:10pm lock+summary (was 9pm), 9pm pre-summary (totals only, auto-deleted at 10:10pm), Tomorrow button locked after 10:10pm, same-date orders auto-merged into one session, in-memory state (pending/state/editing_session/last_confirmation) persisted to DB so bot restarts don't break mid-order flows.
**Next task:** B2B Phase 2 — recurring weekly orders (standing orders with confirmation flow)
**Known issues:** None
**Notes:**
- Retail bot: `python run_bot.py` — systemd: `twbshop-retail`
- B2B bot: `python run_b2b_bot.py` — systemd: `twbshop-b2b`
- Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in config.py to enable AI features (retail bot only for now)

## B2B Orders Bot — b2b_bot/

Handles wholesale orders from restaurant and bar customers via their own Telegram groups.

### B2B Design Rules
- Group chat = the customer. Anyone in the group can order.
- Re-order same day: bot asks "is this extra?", then re-confirms full merged order.
- Gram-required items: pulls from history first, falls back to standard grams (shown in confirmation).
- Attributes (e.g. sesame type): pulls from history first, falls back to menu standard.
- Delivery/pickup: stored per group. New group asked once on first order.
- 10:10:10pm Phnom Penh (UTC+7 = 15:10 UTC): nightly summary to B2B staff group.
- No AI in Phase 1 — rule-based matching only.

### B2B Repo Structure

```

### B2B Build Phases
- [x] Phase 1 — Foundation + full order flow (menu, customers, history, confirmation, delivery, 10:10pm summary)
- [ ] Phase 2 — Recurring weekly orders (standing orders with 7am/1pm/6pm confirmations, 10:10pm cutoff)
  - DB table: b2b_recurring_orders (group_chat_id, items_json, day_of_week, status: active/paused/cancelled)
  - Saturday bot sends at 7am, reminds at 1pm if no reply, reminds again at 6pm, drops at 10:10pm if still no reply
  - Customer presses [Confirm] or [Skip this week] — silence = no order, nothing baked
  - Cancelled permanently: status = 'cancelled', record kept for history, bot never sends again
- [ ] Phase 3 — Claude API for smarter matching and future AI features
