# Bakery Automation System — Project Rules & Status

---

## Real-Path Precision Standard — UNIVERSAL, ENFORCED (full local copy — self-contained)
REAL_PATH_PRECISION_STANDARD_VERSION: 2026-06-09-A

> This is a FULL copy (not a pointer) so the project carries its own enforcement even if the global
> `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` fails to load, is stale on another machine, bootstrap wasn't run, the secrets
> repo is unavailable, or a future session only sees this repo. Reliability > elegance for operating
> constraints. Same text lives in the global file.

Constraints, not values. The bar is EVIDENCE, never promises. Chat stays fast and friendly; proof on
real work never softens. The user may demand the evidence block at ANY time; its absence = NOT done.

### MODES — default UP if unsure.
- **CHAT / THINKING** — explain / plan / review. No ceremony.
- **TRIVIAL EDIT** — comments / docs / wording, no runtime change. Light proof: files + quick check.
- **SHIPPABLE** — any behavior / UI / API / DB / bot / report / deploy change. Full real-path evidence
  before "done."
- **HIGH-RISK** — money / payroll / staff+customer records / audit / deletions / migrations /
  permissions / prod deploy / integrations / secrets. No shortcuts, no "probably," nothing called done
  without real-path proof.

### RULES
1. **ONE REAL SYSTEM — no behavior fork.** Isolate data / routing only, never logic / permissions /
   paths. Isolation reversible with teardown; never pollute real data. Test once → ship that same
   code; go-live only flips routing/config; re-test if code changed.
2. **PROOF, NOT ECHO.** Nothing is done / fixed / live / saved on the operation's own word. Verify
   from an INDEPENDENT read after it settles: **PUSHED ≠ LIVE** (ref==origin, service up, running code
   carries the change); **WRITTEN ≠ SAVED** (commit/close first, then re-read from a SEPARATE
   connection/session/process). A 2xx, RETURNING row, return value, same-transaction read, local
   buffer, or enqueue/send acknowledgement is NOT final proof. Check state yourself before blaming it.
3. **FILES ARE TRUTH, CHAT IS DISPOSABLE.** Persist to the repo as you go; prove from git.
4. **EVERY ACTOR, NO DEAD ENDS.** User-path first and each role's view (backend-only proof is
   insufficient for user-facing work); every control does a real action or faithfully advances through
   a real path.
5. **COVER EVERY BRANCH** — success / fail / cancel / invalid / permission / duplicate / edge; one
   harness per workflow. Fixes become permanent guards (regression test or constraint), never symptom
   patches.
6. **REPORT FAITHFULLY.** Don't ask unless needed, but state assumptions, verify inputs against
   context (flag mismatches before applying), and name any shortcut as a tradeoff before taking it
   (HIGH-RISK: none). SHIPPABLE / HIGH-RISK ends with: files · commands · path verified · evidence
   (independent, post-settlement) · cleanup · regression guard · remaining risk · next step.

### TWBshop HIGH-RISK paths (no shortcuts, real-path proof mandatory)
- Payments / KHQR / Bakong · payroll & salary (staff_registry, slips, pays) · staff records &
  ex-staff offboarding / bans / permissions · DB migrations & deletions · deploys to the twbshop-*
  services (retail / b2b / gm / listener / hire) · attendance go-live (`attendance_live`).
- Attendance test harness design: `docs/ATTENDANCE_TEST_MODE.md`.

## Connectivity Reference
*Broken something? Connectivity checks (SSH · GitHub · DO API/droplet/db · Anthropic · Telegram) → `docs/CONNECTIVITY.md`.*

---

## What This System Does
A Telegram-based bakery operations system that handles:
- Customer orders (received, confirmed, stored)
- Daily production totals sent to the bakery staff group
- Per-customer fulfillment lists (who ordered what, pickup/delivery time)
- Staff workstation and fridge photo submissions
- Stock sheet photo uploads (for later OCR processing)
- Staff communications monitoring (for later AI analysis)

---

## After Every Pull

**Read the "Current Status" section of this file immediately.** It is the only source of truth for what to work on next. Never use memory notes — they are local to one machine and go stale across machines.

**Also read `docs/ACTIONS_LEDGER.md`** — any operational/real-data instruction that's still Open.

---

## Operational Instructions — never drop a real-data change

Real-data instructions (clear/adjust **payback**, deduct/add **AL**, change a **balance**, **staff
record**, **payment**, or any "do X to the numbers") are HIGH-RISK and must NEVER sit unacted — a
dropped one makes the shop's numbers wrong. The rule:

1. **Do it immediately** when instructed, with before/after proof from an INDEPENDENT read (separate
   process/connection) — never defer a data change to "later in the task" or treat it as a chat aside.
2. If it genuinely can't be done right now, **log it to `docs/ACTIONS_LEDGER.md` → Open** the moment
   it's given, and tell the owner plainly it is NOT done yet.
3. **Read `docs/ACTIONS_LEDGER.md` at session start** (with Current Status). At the end of any turn
   where the owner gave instructions, **state the open loops** — "Open items: none" or the list.

Why: an instruction acknowledged only in chat, never executed or written to a file, gets buried by
context compaction and the numbers silently go wrong. Files are truth; chat is disposable. (Once
`attendance_live` flips, most of these happen through the bot's audited button flows, not by hand —
which shrinks this risk on its own.)

---

## Deploy Discipline (restart-safety — read before restarting any service)

A restart is a ~2–3s blip: the bots long-poll, so Telegram **queues** messages during the gap and the
bot drains them on resume — nothing is lost. Polling is the safety net; **never switch to webhooks**
(a down endpoint drops the POST). The risks are small and these three habits remove them. They are
human discipline, not code — honor them on every deploy (Claude enforces them when asked to deploy):

1. **Restart in the quiet window, not at a shift edge.** The only moments a restart can skip a
   prompt are when check-in/checkout jobs fire — roughly **05:30–07:00 · 14:00–15:30 · 20:30–21:30**
   (Phnom-Penh). Deploy in a mid-afternoon lull and even the self-healing risks vanish.
2. **Batch deploys.** Accumulate the day's changes and restart once — don't restart per micro-edit.
   Check `git log origin/main..HEAD` before deploying to see what's actually shipping.
3. **Restart only the changed service.** A `gm` deploy must never touch `twbshop-retail` /
   `twbshop-b2b` (the customer-facing + payment bots). Restart customer bots only when their code
   changed.

**Always verify after restart** (independent proof, not "active"): server `HEAD == origin`, service
`is-active`, and the running code carries the change (grep it). The OT-banking path is idempotent
(atomic claim) so a crash-redelivered duplicate can't double-bank — keep new balance-moving paths
idempotent too (flip status FIRST, before the write).

**All "system down" safeguards live in `docs/RESILIENCE.md`** — the single record (layers, status,
proof, known gaps, incident history). Update it whenever a safeguard is added or changed.

---

## Core Architectural Rules (READ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE)

### 1. AI API Calls Only via shared/ai_client.py
All Claude API calls go through `shared/ai_client.py`. No other module imports the
`anthropic` SDK directly. Natural language order parsing stays rule-based (regex,
difflib).
**AI usage rules by system:**
- Retail/B2B bots: photo analysis, staff message monitoring, receipt clarity
- Hire bot intake: max 2 normal Haiku calls per applicant (intent classification + CV extraction, text only). Optional 3rd call (deflection_check) only after 3 CV deflections. No media/photo analysis before TEST_UNLOCKED. No expensive scoring before arrival. Every Haiku call = exactly one row in hiring_intake_ai_events.
- Hire bot scoring: Opus/Sonnet after TEST_UNLOCKED only
- All AI decisions during intake are logged to `hiring_intake_ai_events` for audit
When ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is empty the system falls back to manual-review mode automatically.

### 2. Always Build the Interface First
For every future AI-powered feature, create the function stub now with a placeholder return before wiring up the API. The stub is the contract — build around it first.

### 3. Confirmation Gate Is Mandatory
The bot must ALWAYS restate an interpreted order and ask for explicit confirmation
before saving anything to the database. No silent acceptance of natural language input.
Example flow:
- Customer types something → bot matches to menu items → bot rephrases clearly →
  customer presses [Confirm] or [Edit] → only then save to database.

### 4. Modular Files — Keep Each File Focused
No giant single files. Small, focused modules so Claude Code can load only what's
relevant in future sessions without hitting context limits.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Telegram:** `python-telegram-bot` library
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean (managed) — `psycopg2`, connection via `DATABASE_URL` in secrets.py
- **Fuzzy Matching:** `difflib` (standard library)
- **Logging:** `RotatingFileHandler` — 5MB cap, 3 backups. Unmatched orders log to `logs/unmatched.log`

---

## Repo Structure
*Need the file layout? → `docs/REPO_STRUCTURE.md` (or just read the filesystem).*

---

## Build Phases

### Retail Bot — Complete
Phases 1–6 done: foundation, menu + ordering, production summaries, photo flow, stock sheets, Claude API layer (OCR, photo analysis, staff monitoring, fallback mode).

---

## New Machine Setup

Just say: **pull**

Claude Code clones the repo, syncs all secrets and SSH keys, and runs bootstrap automatically.
You will be asked for your GitHub PAT (`repo` scope) once — everything else is handled.

PAT creation: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Secrets live in: `github.com/aaaeeeaaarrr/twbshop-secrets` (private)
Claude Code permissions sync automatically via `.claude/settings.json` in this repo.

---

## Key Decisions (Do Not Revisit Without Good Reason)
- **PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean** — migrated from SQLite. All data lives in the managed DO database. No local .db file.
- **Free-first architecture** — API features are additions, not the foundation.
  The bot must work fully without any API calls before any API calls are added.
- **No silent AI guessing** — every ambiguous input goes to a human confirmation step.
  The confirmation gate is not optional, it is the safety mechanism.
- **Telegram only** — no web dashboard, no separate app. Staff and customers
  already use Telegram. Keep the surface area small.

---

## GM Subsystems — status index
*One-line status; full detail → `docs/SUBSYSTEMS.md` (+ the per-topic docs named there).*
- **REPORT finance tracking (GM bot):** LIVE.
- **Supervisors/Management — lateness·AL·tagging:** mostly BUILT; group ladder SILENCED (moved to private-DM).
- **Delivery System (WOC):** SHELVED.
- **Staff Registry · Ex-staff offboarding · Paperless /stock:** BUILT (stock overhaul + 143-item CSV import PENDING).
- **Private-DM Attendance Overhaul:** IN BUILD, gated OFF (current focus) → `docs/ATTENDANCE_SYSTEM_DETAILED.md` + `..._MAP.md` + `..._TEST_MODE.md`.
- **STRATEGIC — POS convergence:** keep our Postgres source-of-truth; AppSheet is a throwaway stock front-end.
- **GM Backlog & Roadmap:** → `docs/ROADMAP.md` (reference, not an auto-run list).
- **Operations Intelligence System:** mostly BUILT (Phase 3 — listener + import + AI tiers + hire bot).

## Current Status
> Update this at the end of every session. The only source of truth for what's next. Old session logs (19–31) → docs/HISTORY.md.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-11 (session 32 cont. pt2 — owner WALKTHROUGH day: 8 real finds fixed live
(dead demos, stateless dry-runs, the unwired mini-shift → slots ARE redefines, buyback twin bug,
real-builder demo cards); points ACTIVATED; accountability pass (every "no" costs a typed reason,
10/20/30 nudge ladder); /audit grew to 19 law families. Suite 476. attendance_live=OFF, test ON.)

**Session 32 (Jun 11, pt2) — walkthrough finds + accountability design. All deployed & verified:**
- **WALKTHROUGH FIXES (owner screenshots → fix → deploy, same hour):** double-tap "not modified" =
  benign no-op in the shared error handler (all bots); dry-run demo buttons restored (slot/1-hour/
  approve demos send their consequence, acks advance); **dry-runs made STATELESS** (step rides in
  the button `att:dr:n:{key}:{i}` — my deploys were wiping user_data → "random stops" + dead
  buttons; legacy buttons get an honest restart note); schedule summary grouped by shift pattern
  (22 staff → 15 blocks); **AL/swap dry-run cards render via the REAL builders** (_al_card/_swap_card
  — real bold span, live coverage, WORKING 👁 toggle that edits in place); dry-runs 4/5/7 audited
  line-by-line vs the real flows (7 drifts synced; marriage approval = the AL engine's message);
  dry-run renumber 1–7; return-check preview buttons = the real bilingual ones.
- **PAYBACK SLOTS ARE SHIFT REDEFINES (owner unification):** the dry-run promised a "mini-shift"
  that NEVER EXISTED (nothing credited a debt from a booked slot — go-live blocker). Booking now
  auto-creates an approved redefine (before/after-edge merge; DAY-OFF = window with normal_len=0 →
  every worked minute credits via the SAME settle engine; partial = clamped naturally; booking →
  'done' at settle). Owner's day-off spec: top-3 neediest windows INSIDE their own shift hours,
  1h/2h/3h partials, full-shift debt ⇒ whole shift. `payback.redefine_window` pure + tests.
- **BUYBACK TWIN BUG (found by "anything for /audit?"):** rest-booking debited NOTHING (same hours
  bookable forever) + attendance would mark earned rest LATE. Now: ot_bank_spend at booking +
  'OT rest' redefine (`ot.rest_redefine`: rest-first→come later, rest-last→leave earlier) + 'taken'
  at settle + group notice "🌴 OT rest: …" (coverage changed = group knows).
- **POINTS ACTIVATED (owner)** with catalogue values (+10 early · −1/−2 late · −2/min no-show ·
  +15 doctor-return · −30 OT no-show · −0.1/min short-notice AL = NEW 7th cause). Found at
  activation: verdict charged EVERYONE the uninformed rate (placeholder) — now **split-late**: the
  declaration MOMENT splits minutes (before it −2, after it −1; pre-start = all −1); short-notice
  AL was shown but never recorded — records at approval vs the REQUEST date. **AL-today gate**
  (owner rule, didn't exist): from start−30, no AL-today button without a CHECK-IN (kills no-show
  laundering). `/testkhmer` etc. from pt1 unchanged.
- **ACCOUNTABILITY PASS (owner design):** every "no" costs a typed reason; positives stay one-tap.
  Sick nudges expectation-first ("I hope your child is better now 🤍 Are you coming tomorrow?");
  family/own-sick/opener "— explain" buttons (the opener's typed reason was being DROPPED — FYI
  now carries it); FAMILY night nudge BUILT (was preview-only): explain → reason → tomorrow books
  (burns 1 of 7) + group reads the reason; **rejections act-FIRST, reason-after** (AL/swap senior
  ❌, partner ✋, staff shift-decline — each relays the typed reason to whoever the decision already
  reached; destinations unchanged); shift-change decline now TELLS the proposing senior; **bounded
  10/20/30 ladder** (`_reason_nudge_job`, 5-min, DB-armed pends with armed_at/nudges): 2 gentle
  nudges then auto-resolve — sick flows BOOK with "(no reason given — asked 3×)" (reality covered,
  non-compliance visible), rejection reasons drop (decision stood).
- **GROUP-NOTICE RULE VERIFIED:** every confirmed outcome lands in Supervisors (2 gaps closed:
  buyback rest + shift-change decline); rejections/completions deliberately silent. AL Supervisors
  notice ENGLISH-only + the missing Back-at-work line (al.back_at_work_date) + hours-AL window.
- **/audit grew to 19 law families:** booking⇄redefine pairing BOTH currencies, v_buybacks (stale
  'booked'), v_sick (status domain, 'extended' chain integrity, >7 family pool, OPEN-past-date =
  nudge never answered), late-points sum law, AL-gate law (start−30, from Jun 11), normal_len=0
  valid. The PB-PAIR law caught a TEST-SUITE LEAK on its first run (autobook test wrote real
  shift_changes rows — mocked now, orphans cancelled, row-count proven stable across a suite run).
  Real+test audits: 0 problems.
- **Daily auto-audit** (07:30 PP, REAL rows, silent when clean, DM on problems); Davy PB cleared
  (owner: "she paid", + test mirror, proof in ledger); dead `secretary.service` removed from the
  server; KH_REVIEW: width rule for buttons + all new drafts in Pending.
**NEXT:** owner continues the walkthrough (dry-runs now stateless + truthful; interactive flows =
the real test) → /audit on test rows → /testreset → flip attendance_live. Kimying restore muted
(auto, Jul 1). Delis pay numbers: owner eyeballs /menu.

**Session 32 (Jun 11, cont.) — reliability + owner-tools day. All deployed & verified:**
- **`/audit` — invariant auditor (checklist B3 capstone):** one command cross-checks every button
  input → stored result over ALL rows: AL (approved+passed ⇒ deducted, rejected ⇒ no deduction),
  PB (cleared ⇔ paid, single open debt), OT (done ⇒ banked 0..14h; approved-past-date = never-settled
  flag), sessions (checkout≥checkin, stale opens), no-show-vs-check-in contradiction, bookings, swaps,
  staff sanity (missing shift times = scheduler skips them). MODE-AWARE: test rows in test mode (audits
  the owner's role-play), real rows live — label says which. Output ✅ clean or paste-to-Claude problem
  lines. Validators pure + unit-tested; first real-data run CLEAN (5 PB + 4 AL rows); mode isolation
  proven (5 real + 5 test PB, 4+4 AL). → `gm_bot/audit.py`.
- **Crash sweep (owner: "check the whole thing"):** found + fixed 5 prod bugs — `gm_save_concern`
  NameError (69 crashes — live concern recorder dead), `cmd_staff` UnboundLocal (shadow import),
  same class in LIVE b2b repeat-order (`_SESAME_LABEL_CODE`), `_B2B_ORDER_IMAGE_SYSTEM` undefined
  (b2b photo-orders silently returned []), /testmode edited-msg crash. Permanent guards:
  `test_no_shadow_import_bugs` (AST scan, all bots), real-DB SQL-typing test, pyflakes clean.
- **Global error handler on ALL FOUR bots** (`shared/error_handler.py`, one impl): any unhandled
  crash → traceback to log + throttled ⚠ owner DM naming bot+button + callback answered (never a
  spinning button). Listener (Telethon): error-burst alert (3+ in 10min → owner DM via GM token).
- **Watchdog was NEVER RUNNING — armed + fixed:** the session-28 collection watchdog's cron DAEMON
  was inactive (never ran once) AND its alert used the retail token → 400 chat-not-found (owner
  never DM'd that bot). Enabled cron (proven by its own tick), alerts now via GM token (test 🚨
  received). → `docs/RESILIENCE.md` (ALL down-safeguards, one record + 60s fire drill).
- **Timestamp fairness:** queued check-ins judged by the staffer's Telegram send time, never bot
  processing time (`_msg_time_pp`) — our downtime can't mark anyone late or fool auto-checkout.
- **Dry-run 1 crash fixed** (`when_date = ANY(%s::date[])` — date=text killed schedule_summary AND
  would've hit the live scheduler); dry-runs renumbered 1–7 (old 6 = retired Now/Later OT).
- **Owner /menu** (owner-only): Staff info → PB+OT (ledger staff only, My-Schedule partition math) ·
  AL+Joined · Salaries 1st/2nd — TWB + Delis sections w/ own totals + grand total; 2nd pay shows
  bonus split ("ANAN — $30 +$20"); Tyty included (1st-only, $1700, record corrected from stale 1500).
  Delis pay data was ALREADY in DB (owner's old Excel import; my earlier "0 of 6" probe had a
  case-sensitivity bug — org is 'DELIS').
- **Hire-date + pay automation:** `joined_date`+`joined_month_only` columns (additive, applied);
  `/joined <name> <date>` (full or MM/YYYY); CURRENT-month full-date join auto-prorates (owner rule
  pinned in payroll.py: ALWAYS 30-day basis; 1st = 80% of prorated rounded UP to 5/0; bonus rides
  2nd unprorated) + `_pay_restore_job` (daily 07:05 PP) restores the full split when the join month
  passes + DMs owner. Kimying (id 42) applied by hand + seeded: 160×27/30=144 → 1st 120 · 2nd 24+15
  bonus; joined 2026-06-04; full split 145/30 auto-restores Jul 1 (ledger: VERIFY the DM).
- **Real-data ops (ledger'd, independently proven):** Chantrea payback cleared (real 27min + test);
  Davy −1.0 AL (15→14). **`docs/ACTIONS_LEDGER.md` + CLAUDE.md rule:** real-data instructions are
  executed immediately with proof or logged Open — never dropped (the Chantrea/Davy lesson).
- **KH:** /testkhmer on|off (test mode shows full bilingual for proof-reading); dry-runs 2–8 resynced
  to live Khmer; hours-AL Supervisors notice KH applied; KH_REVIEW consolidated (one clean copy +
  Pending slot). **Buttons:** every staff picker shows "POR — Chea Chaktopor", sorted by call name.
- **Deploy discipline** in CLAUDE.md (quiet-window/batch/single-service/verify) + TimeoutStopSec=15
  on all 5 units (verified) + OT-banking idempotency claim (no double-bank, regression-tested).
**NEXT:** owner role-play walkthrough (resume Dry-run 2; setup: /testmode on · /testkhmer on ·
/testseed) → /audit on test rows → wording tweaks → points activation → /testreset → flip
attendance_live. Standing: Bedrock delta 2 (owner OS-lock), staging Postgres by 2026-06-30, verify
Kimying restore DM ~Jul 1, Delis pay numbers eyeball.

**Session 32 (Jun 11) — Reason categorization (split-digest idea "A") + restart-safety hardening:**
- **Reason categorization (idea A) — DONE, deployed (`224a659`).** The inverse Brain+model pairing:
  free-text is the model's job, counting is Brain's. `categorize_reasons` (Haiku, one batched call)
  labels each typed lateness reason → fixed category (transport/family/health/oversleep/weather/other),
  analysis-time only, falls back to 'other' on no-key/error, always same-length list.
  `gm_lateness_reasons_since(today, 30)` feeds it (no schema change — computed each digest). The weekly
  digest aggregates the labels (Brain, exact) into a per-staffer 30-day reason MIX shown for flagged
  staffers ("Davy reasons (30d): transport×3, oversleep×1"); Opus 4.8 sees the mix too. Ideas B–E
  (payslip explain · coverage→hire profile · sick-paper cross-check · digest Q&A) PARKED by owner until
  more systems feed the Brain. +2 tests.
- **Restart-safety audit + fixes (owner asked "how harmful are our restarts?").** Architecture verdict:
  long-polling → Telegram QUEUES messages during the ~2–3s blip, nothing lost; separate processes →
  a gm restart never touches retail/b2b; `Restart=always` auto-recovers. Keep polling, never webhooks.
  - **#3 — OT-banking idempotency, DONE & deployed (`fa93251`).** Audit found every balance-moving path
    already safe (status flips FIRST, before the write): AL approve, shift-change approve, daily AL
    deduction, no-show (UNIQUE). The ONE hole: `_settle_redefined_shift` — its double-bank guard
    (`set_banked→done`) ran LAST, after `payback_credit`+`ot_bank_add`, and 3 checkout paths reach it
    (manual · auto-checkout scheduler · crash-redelivered duplicate) → two interleaving = silent
    double-bank. Fix, NO schema change: `shift_change_claim_settle` = atomic `UPDATE…WHERE
    status='approved' RETURNING id` (compare-and-swap on the existing status col); settle now CLAIMS
    before moving any balance, only the winner banks. Failure mode flipped from silent overpay →
    visible underpay (recoverable). +1 regression test (2nd settle banks nothing).
  - **#4 — bounded shutdown, DONE & verified.** `TimeoutStopSec=15` added to all 5 `twbshop-*` units
    (b2b/gm/hire/listener/retail) so a hung stop can't sit at systemd's silent 90s default. Done on the
    server with per-file `.bak` + `daemon-reload`; loaded value verified `15s` via `systemctl show` on
    every unit (no restart needed — applies next stop; all stayed active).
  - **Deploy discipline (rules 1+2+5) — lighter trip, no script (owner choice).** `CLAUDE.md` "Deploy
    Discipline" block: quiet-window (05:30–07:00·14:00–15:30·20:30–21:30 PP) · batch deploys · restart
    only the changed service · always verify after (HEAD==origin, active, grep the change). Loads every
    session; Claude enforces on deploy. Pointer in `docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`.

**Session 32 (Jun 10) — Bedrock deltas 1+3+5 SHIPPED + wiring-tested 12/12.** The
`#HIGHRISK-OK` self-approval marker is GONE: catastrophic actions now hard-block with NO override and a
`🛑 NEEDS YOU — run: ! <cmd>` owner-paste message. Guard split command-checks from path-checks (fixes
read-only false-positives). secret_guard now scans staged/unpushed diffs before commit+push. Ratchet
removal trigger written. → `docs/BEDROCK.md`. REMAINING: delta 2 = OWNER OS-locks the global guard files
in an elevated shell, then back to attendance.

**Session 32 (Jun 10) — Bedrock guards hardened + proven (deltas 1/3/5):**
- Rewrote `highrisk_guard.py` + `secret_guard.py` in repo `.claude/hooks/` AND live global
  `~/.claude/hooks/`. Smoke harness: 12/12 (destructive SQL · rm -rf · force-push · secrets.py path ·
  guard-hook path · live API key → BLOCK; git status · cat/edit normal file · key→secrets.py → PASS).
  Delta-1 no-override confirmed live (a DROP-bearing test command hard-blocked mid-session, no bypass).
- ⏳ **Bedrock delta 2 (owner):** elevated shell, `icacls`/`Set-Acl` the global enforcing files to
  admin-owned + Papa ReadAndExecute, read ACL back to prove. (Optional: grep for a psycopg2 DDL path
  that dodges the CMD patterns.)

**Session 32 (Jun 10) — OT redefine WIRED into live attendance + dead Now/Later model REMOVED:**
- **Attendance now obeys the redefine** (was decorative): `shift_changes_active_map` (batch lookup),
  `staff_day_events(ws_override,len_override)`, `compute_day_events` resolves a redefine per
  (staff, shift-start-date) and lets `works_on` honor a change-day onto a day-off; the check-in
  scheduler fires T−10/T0/T+5 + checkout at the redefined `[start,end]` (old `ot_now_end_times` "extend"
  pass deleted — redefined checkout rides the event stream); `_handle_staff_location` verdict measures
  lateness vs the **redefined** start. (commit "Attendance obeys redefined shift times", part 1/2)
- **Dead Now/Later GRANT model ripped** (owner: superseded by Give-OT/change-shift): removed the
  `att:ot:` picker (ot_nowlater/staff_pick/when_day/start/end/stub/owner_card/approved_preview),
  `submit_ot_grant`, `_ot_owner_callback`/`_ot_future_callback`/`_ot_started`/`_ot_window`, Dry-run 6,
  the `flow=="ot"` dispatch + 2 handler regs, and 5 old tests. **KEPT** (shared/future): `_ot_receiver`,
  `_present_now`, `ot_screen` (personal bank view), `_offer_buyback`/`_ot_buyback_callback`/
  `takeback_windows` (spend-the-bank side the redefine model still needs), DB `ot_grant_*` dormant.
  Suite **420** green; both modules import clean. (part 2/2)
- **OVERNIGHT date-binding FIXED (owner asked "does past-midnight hide a problem?" — yes, 2):**
  `compute_day_events` events now carry their **shift-START date** (5-tuple) and the scheduler uses it
  for (1) the checkout arm — `flow_save shift_date=sd` so an overnight checkout writes to YESTERDAY's
  session and `_settle_redefined_shift` finds the redefine → **OT actually banks** (was: wrote to a
  nonexistent today-session, silently never banked); (2) the suppression lookup — `att_get_session(sd)`
  so a checked-out overnighter isn't re-nudged at 6:10/6:20/6:40am. + overnight regression test
  (`test_compute_day_events_overnight_carries_shift_date`). Suite **421**.
- **MID-SHIFT EXTENSION built (problem 4, owner picked "future-proof"):** `_sc_running(sid)` resolves
  the shift RUNNING now — overnight-aware (a 2am baker returns tdidx **−1** + yesterday's date, which
  the work-day list can't express) and redefine-aware (approved shift_change supplies effective times,
  incl. on a day-off). Mid-shift today: `sc_mode` swaps "Change time" for **"⏱ Extend the end (started
  X)"** — start LOCKED to the real start, straight to the end ladder; "Change day" stays (the owner's
  future-proof choice). `sc_day_pick` grows a "⚡ Extend the shift running NOW" top button (the ONLY
  route to yesterday's overnight date). Leak-guards: `sc_start` bounces to the locked mode screen if
  the shift is running today (covers Back-nav); `sc_end`'s Back for tdidx<0 goes to the day list, never
  a start ladder for a date whose start happened. +7 tests (running detection day/overnight/redefine/
  day-off; the 3 screens; both leak guards). New KH drafts → docs/KH_REVIEW.md §5b. Suite **428**.
- **SETTLE OVER-PAY CLAMPED (problem 3):** `_settle_redefined_shift` now counts only presence INSIDE
  the approved `[start,end]` — `worked = min(co, appr_end) − max(ci, appr_start)` (overnight-safe via
  raw minutes on the shift-date base). Early arrival earns points never OT; lingering past the approved
  end banks nothing; late still reduces. + `test_settle_clamps_to_approved_window` (on-time / early+
  linger / 2h-late). Suite **429**. All four overnight-audit problems are now FIXED.
- **SHIELD built (OT_DESIGN §4):** `ot_shield_until(staff_id, today, by_date)` — the latest-per-date
  APPROVED redefine that still CARRIES OT (end > start+normal_len) landing in [today, debt deadline].
  `_payback_ladder_job` skips warn/auto-book while it stands (deadline = `created_date +
  payback.PB_DEADLINE_DAYS` (14, new constant)). **Stateless re-exposure by construction:** decline/
  cancel = status change, re-edit-to-no-OT = latest-per-date wins, absence = date passes — all just
  stop matching and the ladder resumes next daily run; 'done' never matches (its OT already settled
  the debt at checkout). NOTE: the calm daily check-in line still shows (debt genuinely exists until
  the OT clears it) — only warn/auto-book pause. +2 tests. Suite **431**.
- **AUTO-CHECKOUT built + hardened (owner):** at shift end, if the live share stayed ON + IN-ZONE the
  scheduler closes the session silently + settles OT (auto-banks overnight OT) — `checkin.can_auto_checkout`
  (pure) + `att_last_ping`. **Grace = 3 min** (owner lowered from 12: tighter end-of-shift gap; still
  fires for a stationary phone's sparse heartbeats). **Live-share STOP detected** —
  `checkin.is_share_stop(is_edited, live_period)`: a stopped share = an EDITED update with live_period
  gone → recorded in-zone=False so auto-checkout never trusts a share they just turned off (a static
  pin is a NEW msg, an active update keeps live_period — neither matches). **Every successful checkout
  (manual + auto) now sends `_CO_DONE` = "Checked out ✓ Thank you, have a nice day! 🤍" (KH draft in
  KH_REVIEW §1.1).** +2 tests (grace-3 boundary; stop discriminator). Suite **433**.
- **`/test` SIMULATE-CHECKOUT built:** check-in simulator → "⑦ ✅ Simulate full checkout (settle +
  banking)" (`att:cisco:`, `_ci_simcheckout_callback`). Ensures a check-in, checks out at the
  (redefined, overnight-aware) shift end, runs the REAL `_settle_redefined_shift`, and reports
  worked · OT earned vs normal · payback cleared · OT banked + sends the `_CO_DONE` thank-you — so
  Give-OT → approve → checkout → banking is walkable with no live mode (test-isolated; real bank
  untouched). +1 test. Suite **434**.
- **BUYBACK wired onto settle (OT bank→rest loop closed):** `_settle_redefined_shift` now returns
  `(banked_min, new_bank_balance)`; all three checkout paths (manual share-to-checkout, scheduler
  auto-checkout, `/test` simulate-checkout) call `_offer_buyback` when `banked > 0` — the staffer is
  offered the safest (most-surplus) shift-edge times to take the earned OT back as rest (`att:otb:`
  booking still live). So the full OT life-cycle — Give-OT → approve → work → checkout → bank → spend
  as rest — is now end-to-end. Suite **434**.
- **BUILD #1a — TEST CLOCK done:** `_now_pp()` / `_today_pp()` return a frozen owner-set "pretend now"
  (`att_test_now`) ONLY in test mode (never time-warps live staff). `/testclock` command + `_parse_testclock`
  (`+3d` · `-90m` · `tomorrow 08:00` · `2026-06-15 06:00` · `off`). Routed the **is_test-safe** time
  reads through it: checkin scheduler, payback ladder (+shield deadline), no-show sweep, sick
  papers-deadline + night-nudge, booking reminder, location verdict, payback/buyback slot lists, the
  /test sim helpers. **Deliberately NOT routed** (real-data / real-cadence): `_al_accrual_job`,
  `_al_deduction_job`, report watchdogs, payroll month calc, weekly digest. +2 tests. Suite **436**.
- **BUILD #1b — JOB TRIGGERS done:** `/testrun <job>` fires a scheduled job's body ONCE on demand,
  against the test clock, bypassing the gate via `_job_gate(live_only=)` + a `_TEST_FORCE_RUN` flag
  (forces ON only while /testrun runs AND in test mode — real staff never force-fired). Exposed:
  `checkin` (scheduler tick incl. auto-checkout) · `noshow` · `ladder` (warn/auto-book) · `booking` ·
  `sickdeadline`. (Excludes `_callout_job` — spends Opus — and the real-data accrual/deduction jobs.)
  So: `/testmode on` → `/testclock +3d` → `/testrun ladder` shows day-3/4 escalation in seconds. The
  5 job gates now read `_job_gate()`. +2 tests; fixed 2 dispatch tests that newly touched the clock
  (stub `_now_pp`). Suite **438**. **BUILD #1 COMPLETE.**
- ⏳ **Attendance NEXT:** optional coverage-scenario seeding for multi-person rules; then GO-LIVE PREP
  — owner walks every flow + every /testrun job in `/test`, tweak KH wording, `/testreset`, then flip
  `attendance_live`. The OT/redefine feature + the time-driven harness are now fully rehearsable offline.
  attendance_live=OFF, attendance_test_mode=OFF.
- **NOTE (guard false-positive):** the HIGH-RISK guard blocks any Bash command whose text contains
  `payroll`/`salary`/`staff_registry` etc. — including a **git commit whose MESSAGE** mentions them.
  Worked around by rewording; a future guard-tuning pass should exempt commit-message bodies.

**Session 32 (Jun 11) — ChatGPT KH batch WIRED into code:** applied the polished native Khmer from
`docs/KH_REVIEW.md` to the live strings — checkout thank-you (`សូមឱ្យថ្ងៃនេះល្អៗ`), AL-approved
(`ប្អូន`/`បានអនុម័ត`), all swap status lines (`កំពុងរង់ចាំបងៗអនុម័ត`, `កំពុងរង់ចាំដៃគូយល់ព្រម`,
`ប្អូនបានយល់ព្រមហើយ`, softer `ដៃគូមិនបានយល់ព្រម`), coverage toggle (`ពេលនោះ`), reason prompts,
mid-shift extension (`ធ្វើវេន`/`ម៉ោងចប់`/`ដែលកំពុងដំណើរការ`), bereavement-compassion (warmer), group
redirect + swap prompt/cards now bilingual (`ប្អូន`), `Day off = No AL used · ថ្ងៃឈប់ = មិនដក AL`. The
shift-change card got `+10 points ⭐`. Cleared the live `(KH pending review)` tags. Deviations logged
at the top of KH_REVIEW. Suite **440**; both modules import clean.

**Session 32 (Jun 11) — earlier owner fixes from the KH pass:**
- **⭐ positive-points convention:** every positive-points mention carries the star (`+10 points ⭐`).
  Fixed the one outlier — the shift-change approval card said `+10 points` / `+10 ពិន្ទុ` (no star);
  now `+10 points ⭐` both languages, with ChatGPT's better KH body.
- **AL over-balance → tell the STAFF, not seniors:** `_att_dispatch` flow=="al" now computes the
  requested amount (`_al_requested_amount`, mirrors `_al_finalize`) vs `al_left`; if over, the staffer
  gets "⚠ You only have X AL — pick a smaller amount (up to X)" and the request is NOT submitted.
  Special-leave flows (marriage/death/birth, which may go negative) are untouched. The old §2.6 senior
  insufficient-balance flag was only ever a dry-run preview — now retired. +2 tests. Suite **440**.

**Session 31 (Jun 10) — AL hours-display + reason-prompt becomes an "awaiting approval" card (owner):**
- **"Fractional deduction" wording removed** everywhere (the hours-AL detail + the ③ HOURS-AL help
  label). Hours-AL now shows the **actual AL amount** ("AL: Mon 23/06 · 9pm–12am = 0.3 AL") instead of
  the meaningless "Hours AL" — `fractional_al(f,t,shift_len) × charged-days`, day-offs excluded
  ("Day off = Free").
- **Reason prompt no longer sits stale.** When a flow captures its prompt (`_arm_pending` now stores
  the prompt message's coords for EVERY flow), typing the reason **edits that message in place** into a
  card: same info + `📝 <reason>` + `⏳ Awaiting approval · កំពុងរង់ចាំការអនុម័ត` (done in
  `_att_dispatch`'s `confirm`, gated on `pend['_summary']`). **Wired:** AL (days + hours), the new
  shift-redefine (`scp`), day-off swap. **Not wired (by design):** sick/marriage/death/birth (already
  tappable confirm CARDS, not stale prompts) and the dormant old Now/Later OT picker (slated for removal).
- Suite green (+ `test_dispatch_al_edits_prompt_into_awaiting_card`; the 3 `_arm_pending`
  signature tests updated to pass an `update`). Owner verifies the live edit in `/test` post-deploy.
- **Persistent "👁 Show / 🙈 Hide who's working" toggle across EVERY card state.** One unified
  `_al_card(audience=senior|staff)` renders the senior card AND the requester's own card in
  pending/approved/rejected, each carrying the toggle: the requester's reason prompt now edits into
  THEIR own AL card (toggle + "⏳ Awaiting approval"), registered in `al_staff_cards` so `_al_finalize`
  flips it to the verdict; senior cards KEEP the toggle after the decision (was: buttons vanished).
  `_al_coverage_toggle` is audience-aware + works in any status. **Day-off swap** got the same:
  `_swap_card(audience=partner|senior|requester)` + `_swap_coverage_html` (BOTH affected days'
  coverage) + `att:swcov:{id}:{audience}:` toggle, persisting through pending → partner_ok →
  approved/rejected on ALL THREE swap cards (partner card, senior cards, requester's own card — the
  latter two registered in `swap_partner_cards`/`swap_req_cards` so `_swap_apply` flips them).
  **Pre-reason PICKER prompt** also got the toggle: `_al_prompt` (attendance_ui) computes coverage
  LIVE from the in-progress day/hours selection (`att:al:cov:` + a stash), so staff can check who's
  working BEFORE typing the reason. The **day-off-swap pre-reason prompt** now has it too
  (`_swap_prompt` + `att:do:cov:` + `_swap_both_days_lines`). Coverage header + toggle button are now
  **bilingual** everywhere ("Working those hours/days · អ្នកធ្វើការម៉ោងនោះ/ថ្ងៃនោះ"; "Show/Hide who's
  working · បង្ហាញ/លាក់អ្នកធ្វើការ"). **All today's new/changed bilingual strings gathered for native
  review → `docs/KH_REVIEW.md`** (KH is my draft, needs a ChatGPT pass). Suite **423**.

**⏳ IN PROGRESS (session 31) — OT / shift-redefine rebuild → full settled design in `docs/OT_DESIGN.md`.**
Owner redesigned OT into a UNIFIED **"redefine-a-shift"** model: a senior retimes / moves / extends a
working day's shift, the staff approves, and OT is EMERGENT = hours worked beyond the normal shift
length. Normal late/leave-early/no-show rules apply (no special OT −10 card). PB and OT are ONE currency
(an extension/earned-OT clears payback first, then banks; points stay separate; agreed OT shields the PB
ladder before deadline). Cancellation = re-edit or absence. Day-off payback (within regular shift hours,
natural cap). **DONE + tested:** spec + decision log; `gm_bot/ot.py` length-based OT +
`split_ot_pb`/`apply_ot_to_pb`/`settle_shift` + `end_option_tags` ladder; `payback.dayoff_*` primitive;
`shift_changes` table (additive) + lifecycle CRUD; **propose** (`submit_shift_change` + approval card) +
**approve/decline** (`_shift_change_callback`, registered `att:sc:`); **bank-at-checkout**
(`_settle_redefined_shift` in `_handle_staff_location` — settle + PB-net + 14h cap, is_test end-to-end
proven); **day-off payback slot WIRED** into `_payback_slot_keyboard`; **PICKER UI REBUILT + WIRED**
(`attendance_ui` `sc_*` screens under `att:scp:` — staff→work-day→[Change time | Change day→nearest 2
day-offs]→start ladder→end ladder w/ +PB/+OT tags→reason→`submit_shift_change`; entry "➕ Give OT / change
shift"; bot dispatch `flow=="shift"`; old Now/Later chain dormant). The new flow shows in `/test`.
**NEXT:** **attendance USES the redefined times** (`_checkin_scheduler_job` + verdict read
`shift_change_active` so check-in/out fire at the redefined start/end and lateness is vs the redefined
start); the **shield** (approved OT pauses the PB ladder); remove the dormant old OT picker; `/test`
harness polish (a simulate-checkout that shows the banking). Honest: picker tap-through is owner-verified
in `/test`, not unit-tested (gated UI). attendance_live=OFF, attendance_test_mode=OFF.

**▶ RESUME HERE (session 31 → next session): BEDROCK deltas, then prove, then attendance.**
Bedrock (Standards+Guards+Ratchet) is converged + documented → **`docs/BEDROCK.md`** (read it first).
Architecture review is CLOSED — no more abstract review; the next move is PROOF. Order (CORRECTED —
OS boundary moves LAST so guard edits don't need elevation mid-build):
  1. **Claude:** apply deltas 1/3/5 to the real files — the final guard write also REMOVES the
     `#HIGHRISK-OK` marker (catastrophic set → block-and-owner-runs-manually) · gate secrets at
     commit/push/upload not just write · give the Ratchet a removal trigger.
  2. **Fresh-session wiring test (only real proof):** bypass mode — a catastrophic action with NO
     override must die on exit 2; verify the owner-run path; grep for a DB write path that dodges the
     guard.
  3. **OWNER locks** the GLOBAL enforcing files (`~/.claude/hooks/*.py` + `~/.claude/settings.json`),
     elevated shell — owner→Administrators/SYSTEM, Papa→ReadAndExecute. FEASIBILITY VERIFIED session 31
     (Claude non-elevated + UAC prompts → real boundary; see docs/BEDROCK.md). Read the ACL back to prove.
  4. Then attendance: (a) **Bank-on-completion for OT** (the only fix for "leave early, keep OT pay");
     (b) **Go-live prep** (owner role-play → /testreset → /testmode off → greeting + 📋 Menu → flip
     attendance_live). **No universal tests gate** (project-opt-in, push/deploy-time only).
NOTE: PowerShell-tool coverage + global hooks are now ACTIVE this session (verified — a PS call to a
guard path hard-blocked). attendance_live=OFF, attendance_test_mode=OFF.

**⏰ DATED CHECKPOINT (set 2026-06-08): stand up a staging/local Postgres so the prod DATABASE_URL
is NOT present during normal development.** Today dev and prod share the managed DO Postgres — every
migration/query in dev hits live payroll/staff data. The HIGH-RISK hook (.claude/hooks/highrisk_guard.py)
is a BACKSTOP, not the fix; the real lock is a missing prod credential in dev. Target: before the next
migration/payroll/payment task, and no later than **2026-06-30**. Don't let it become "never."

**Phase:** Retail complete · B2B Phases 1+2 · GM Manager live · Ops listener live · Hiring intake+quiz+assessment built. Attendance system in build (gated OFF).
